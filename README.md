# Incremental Sum Calculator
Description
The Incremental Sum Calculator is a simple C program that calculates the sum of all natural numbers from 1 to a user-defined integer ( n ). The program iteratively adds each number to a cumulative sum and displays each number in the sequence.

Features
Prompts the user to enter a positive integer.
Calculates the sum of all natural numbers from 1 to ( n ).
Displays each number in the sequence as it is added to the sum.
Outputs the final sum after the calculation is complete.
How It Works
The program starts by prompting the user to enter a positive integer ( n ).
It initializes a variable sum to 0 to hold the cumulative sum.
A for loop iterates from 1 to ( n ):
In each iteration, the current number ( i ) is added to sum.
The program prints the current number ( i ) to the console.
After the loop completes, the program prints the total sum of the numbers from 1 to ( n ).
